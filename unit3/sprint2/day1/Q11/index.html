                <p>While searching for different fields, he came across coding and began learning about it from online
                    sources. Once he
                    started enjoying himself, he looked for full-time job roles in this domain but could not find
                    anything worthwhile. Watch here!</p>

                    Coding upon his
                    brother's advice. After some research, Chandan landed at Masai School to learn Full Stack Web
