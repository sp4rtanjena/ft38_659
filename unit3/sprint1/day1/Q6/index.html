        <h1>Answer:</h1>
        <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
        <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is
            a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
        <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
        <p>The <span style="background-color: yellow;">periodic table</span> is a tabular arrangement of chemical
            elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for
            oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
        <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
        <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of a <i>chemical
                reation</i>:</p>
        <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + &Ouml;<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H<sub>2</sub>&Ouml;</p>
        <p>This equation reprsents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>) and oxygen gas
            (<i>O<sub>2</sub></i>) to form water (<i>H<sub>2</sub>&Ouml</i>).</p>
        <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
        <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing
            chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserverd.</p>
        <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while
            <sup>superscripts</sup> reprsent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.
        </p>
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we
            breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
